# A Simple Helper for Wordle

## Basic Usage

1. Clone the repo and run `python play.py`
2. Select a word from the list, or type your own choice of word
3. Type the same word into Wordle
4. Based on the results in Wordle, type a sequence of five letters
	1. `x` for black
	2. `y` for yellow
	3. `g` for green
5. Repeat until you have solved the Wordle (or failed to)

## Some minor notes

* The wordlist includes some entries that Wordle doesn't consider words
* You can press `return` to select the first input in the list
* You can type `m` or `more` to get more choices
